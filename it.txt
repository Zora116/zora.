Giant pandas have a long history. The oldest member of the giant panda, the first panda, has been found in Lufeng and Yuanmou, Yunnan Province, China. Its geological age is about 8 million years ago in the late Miocene. In the long-term harsh competition for survival and natural selection, many of the animals of their time have been extinct, but giant pandas are the strong ones, and they have become "living fossils" so far. Chinese people have known about panda for a long time. As early as the beginning of writing, various appellations of panda were recorded. The book of songs is called Hu, the poem of Mao is called Bai Pi, the records of Mount Emei is called Hu, the book of beasts is called raccoon dog, Li Shizhen's Compendium of Materia Medica is called tapir, and so on.

The modern name of the giant panda (i.e. the Chinese name commonly used in China) was originally named Maoxiong or big Maoxiong, which means that its face is round and fat like a cat, but its whole body is like a bear, and some even put it under the Ursidae. Before the 1950s, the Chinese writing style was straight book, reading from right to left, and then from left to right after changing to horizontal book. When Beibei Museum in Sichuan exhibited in 1939, the title was horizontal book, named panda. At that time, visitors were used to reading straight book from right to left, mistaking panda.

<h2>Morphological character</h2>
<p>
Giant pandas are plump and bear like, with round head and short tail, 1.2-1.8 meters long head and 10-12 cm long tail. The weight of the panda is 80-120 kg, and the maximum weight is 180 kg. The weight of the panda is slightly heavier than that of the female. Head and body hair color black and white, but black is not pure black, white is not pure white, but black in brown, white with yellow. The individuals in Qinling area are larger, with rough body hair and brown belly hair. Minshan (especially Qingchuan Pingwu) is smaller, its body hair is thinner than the former, and its belly hair is not obvious brown, but Liangshan is not too small. The black-and-white appearance is conducive to hiding in dense forest trees and snow covered ground, and is not easy to be found by natural enemies. The relatively sharp claws and strong front and rear limbs are beneficial for giant pandas to climb tall trees quickly.

The skin of giant panda is thick, and the thickest part can reach 10 mm. The skin thickness of different parts of the body is also different. The back of the body is thicker than the ventral side, and the outer side is thicker than the inner side. The average thickness of the skin is about 5mm, and it is white, elastic and resilient.

<h3>Habitat</h3>
<p>
Giant pandas live in high mountains and deep valleys in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River in China. They are windward of the southeast monsoon. The climate is warm, cool and humid, and their humidity is often more than 80%. They are a kind of humidity loving animals. Giant pandas live in six long and narrow areas, including Minshan Mountain, Qionglai mountain, Liangshan Mountain, Daxiangling mountain, Xiaoxiangling mountain and Qinling mountain. They span 45 counties (cities) in Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, with a habitat area of more than 20000 square kilometers and a population of about 1600. More than 80% of them are distributed in Sichuan. Their active areas are mostly in the depression, valley terrace and so on, generally in the gentle slope terrain below 20 degrees. In these areas, the forests are luxuriant, the bamboos grow well, the temperature is relatively stable, the concealment conditions are good, and the food resources and water sources are rich.

<h4>Life habit</h4>
<p>
In addition to half of the time that pandas eat, most of the rest of the time is spent in sleep. In the wild, giant pandas sleep for 2-4 hours between every two meals. Lying flat, lying on their side, lying prone, stretching or curling up are their preferred sleeping methods. In the zoo, the keepers feed them regularly twice a day, so the pandas spend the rest of their time resting. Giant pandas look cute even when they are sleeping. They are very flexible and can put their bulky bodies in various positions. The favorite position is to hold your legs on the tree and cover your eyes with your hands.
Giant pandas are good at climbing trees and playing. The behavior of climbing trees is usually a way to avoid the strong when approaching the marriage proposal period, or to avoid danger, or when meeting each other. Sometimes, pandas go down to the valley and string into villages or houses.
